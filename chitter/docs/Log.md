Day 1 â€“ 22/11/23

I decided on rough project aims, which are:

- To use the front end of my Chitter challenge (Twitter clone) and
  rebuild the back end using Spring Boot, retaining MongoDB as the data
  persistence layer.
- Implement posting/getting peeps (tweets) and
  login/sign up functionality.
- Do this using TDD.
- Add JWT authentication if time allowed for enhanced security.

Since I had not used Spring Boot before, I began doing some general research. I decided to work through two BezKoder tutorials that walked through building a Spring Boot REST API and testing. The repository I was working on can be found [here](https://github.com/liamrisdon/spring-boot-tutorial-walkthrough).

These allowed me to see an example of a CRUD operations being made to a MongoDB database and analyse what each line of code was doing. I identified further tutorials that looked at adding JWT authentication with Spring Security which I could work through to add authentication to my login/sign up functionality, if time allowed.
